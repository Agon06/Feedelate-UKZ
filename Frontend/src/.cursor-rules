You are coding inside a React project. Always follow these rules when generating code:

Code Style & Quality

Write clean, readable, and maintainable code following modern React best practices.

Prefer functional components and React Hooks over class components.

Use ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, template strings, destructuring, spread operator, optional chaining).

Keep components small, modular, and reusable.

Never write unused variables or unreachable code.

Project Structure

Organize code in clear folder structures (components/, hooks/, utils/, services/).

Extract repeated logic into custom hooks or utility functions.

Use meaningful, descriptive file and function names.

State Management & Logic

Use useState, useEffect, useMemo, useCallback, and custom hooks properly.

Avoid unnecessary re-renders; optimize when needed with memoization.

Keep business logic separated from UI components when possible.

UI & JSX

Keep JSX clean and minimal; avoid deeply nested structures.

Format JSX attributes on separate lines when complex.

Use semantic HTML and accessible attributes (aria-label, roles, alt, etc.).

Error Handling & Reliability

Always handle possible errors (API calls, null states, async functions).

Validate props and state where needed.

Avoid hardcoding values; use config files or environment variables.

API & Async Code

Use async/await and wrap promises in try/catch.

Create a centralized API helper/service to manage fetch/axios calls.

Keep components free of direct API logic when possible.

Performance

Avoid heavy computations inside rendering functions.

Use React’s lazy loading and suspense where appropriate.

Optimize lists with keys and memoization when needed.

Documentation

Add brief comments only where logic is complex.

Keep code self-explanatory; avoid redundant comments.

Behavior with Suggestions

Never generate outdated patterns (class components, old lifecycle methods).

Always propose improvements if the existing code can be optimized.

Follow all rules even when modifying or completing existing code.
